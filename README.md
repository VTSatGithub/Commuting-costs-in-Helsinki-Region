# Commuting-in-Helsinki-region
How much does it cost to get from A to B in Helsinki Region? I compared 4 modes of transport: private car, public transport, car sharing service and Taxi. Cost as a function of distance for each mode is calculated and visualized for different average speeds.
The script can be easily modified to do analysis for other cities.
